# Blind-Assistance-App
Developed an Android application in Kotlin that streams frames from ESP32-CAM mounted on a pair of  spectacles which uses TensorFlow Lite models for real-time image captioning along with text reading (OCR).  Integrated Text-to-Speech (TTS) and voice activation for fully hands-free accessibility.
